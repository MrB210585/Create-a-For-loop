The connection_attempts variable is set to 3.
The for loop starts.
range(3) generates the sequence 0, 1, 2.
The loop iterates three times:

First iteration: i is 0, and "Connection could not be established" is printed.

Second iteration: i is 1, and "Connection could not be established" is printed.

Third iteration: i is 2, and "Connection could not be established" is printed.

The loop finishes with an output that prints:
Connection could not be established Connection could not be established Connection could not be established
